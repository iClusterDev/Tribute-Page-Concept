# Tribute Page

### Design Concept

This project is part of the FCC challenges within the Responsive Web Design section.
\
The tribute page is developed using Sass and VanillaJS. All the Sass code is compiled into CSS and the JavaScript is transpiled (browserify/babel) using Gulp4 as a build tool. All the images are compressed as well.\
\
The main feature of the project is the usage of CSS grid, allowing an asymmetric consistent design of the sections, where the section elements overlap on smaller screen sizes.
